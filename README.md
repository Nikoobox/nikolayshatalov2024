# nikolayshatalov2024

A TypeScript-based single-page portfolio built with `Create React App`, featuring `Material UI` library for styling, along with `Particles.js`, `typewriter-effect`, `react-wavify`, and `framer-motion` for dynamic and interactive animations. The application employs reusable components and UI elements to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication. A custom `mui theme` has been implemented to define default styling across the app.

`React.lazy` and `React.Suspense` are used to improve user experience by displaying a loading indicator while waiting for a component to load.

`EmailJS` has been integrated to handle contact form submissions. The `react-hook-form` library is utilized for optimal form state management and validation, and the `react-pdf` package is used to render the PDF resume inside a modal.

The `posthog-js` library provides feature flags, enabling a better development experience and smoother feature releases.
