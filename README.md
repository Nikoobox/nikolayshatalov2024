ðŸš€ A `TypeScript` single-page portfolio built with `Create React App`, featuring `Material UI` library for styling, along with `Particles.js`, `typewriter-effect`, `react-wavify`, and `framer-motion` for dynamic and interactive animations. The application employs reusable components and UI elements to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication. A custom `mui theme` has been implemented to define default styling across the app.

ðŸŒ— `Dark Mode` & `Light Mode` Implementation
This project includes a custom theme toggle between `dark` and `light` modes, utilizing `MUI` theming system. The implementation leverages React's state management to persist user preferences:

Custom Design Tokens: `getDesignTokens` generates theme variations based on the active mode (`light` or `dark`). These tokens define custom palettes, backgrounds, and typography settings.
State Management: The `useCustomTheme` hook manages the theme mode using React's `useState`, and persists the user's preference in `localStorage`.
Theme Creation: The active theme is dynamically generated with `createTheme` and memoized via `useMemo` for performance optimization.
Mode Toggle: Users can switch between modes using the `toggleDarkMode` function, which updates the state and re-applies the theme.
This setup ensures a consistent and customizable user interface, adapting to both user preferences and system settings.

`React.lazy` and `React.Suspense` are used to improve user experience by displaying a loading indicator while waiting for a component to load.

`EmailJS` has been integrated to handle contact form submissions. The `react-hook-form` library is utilized for optimal form state management and validation, and the `react-pdf` package is used to render the PDF resume inside a modal.

The `posthog-js` library provides feature flags, enabling a better development experience and smoother feature releases.
